	  <p><strong>Assignment: Build a tower out of straws, tape, string, and a cup that can hold the most pennies in the cup without the cup touching the ground</strong></p>
	  <p>Plan: The plan was to make a rectangular pyramid out of the straws, as this seemed to be the most resilient structure for weight-bearing. The cup would be tied to the center, with the intention to distribute the weight of the pennies onto all 4 supports of the pyramid.
	  <img src="StrawTower.jpg" alt="Straw Tower" style="width:400px;height:300px;" rotate="90">
	  <p>Result: Our structure actually preformed the worst, as the cup touched the ground after 2 pennies were placed in the cup.</p>
  	  <p>Conclusion: Our original structure was actually one of the best ideas, but our problem was that the pyramid was too close to the ground, and therefore could only hold a few pennies. The structure was strong, as it used triangles as weight-bearers, but the elasticity of the string caused the cup to drop under light weight.
	  <p>My Contribution: I suggested that we incorperate triangles because they are strong
