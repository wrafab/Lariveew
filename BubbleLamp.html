  <p>Assignment: Build a "Lamp Shade" using the 3D printer</p>

<body>
    <p> I had an idea in mind for a lamp when I started. I wanted to take a glass water bottle and put it into a 3D printed base that had colorful LEDS to light up the water in the bottle. I also wanted to add an air pump and some tubeing into the lamp to give the effect of bubbles in the water.</p>
    <p> The first step was to make the base and top of the lamp. I had a water bottle that I thought would work, so I made the base to surround that. On the bottom base, I added some stands so I would have room to put the LEDS under the water bottle. I also added a hole in the back so I could route wire through to power the LEDS. I molded the top around the cap of the water bottle so I could screw it on. This made the lamp easy to open if needed and also saved me the time and frustration of trying to waterproof the plastic top. Finally, I hollowed out the top so I had room for a small air pump and again added a hole for wires. I also made a cap for the top to cover up the hollowed gap so it would look cleaner.</p>

    <p> The printed parts turned out ok, but they were a bit smaller than I thought (or the bottle was bigger).After some heavy sanding, I finally got the parts to squeeze into place. I added the LEDS to the bottom base and routed the wire out the side hole. Instead of buying an air pump, I decided to try and make one using a bottle cap, a balloon, and a computer fan motor.</p>
    <p> I secured the balloon tightly onto the bottle cap with a clamp and some super glue. I drilled 3 holes into the cap, 1 for the air tube and 2 for airflow. In front of the airflow holes I glued some rubber so the pumped air would be forced out the air tube instead of back out the holes. After some modifications to the motor, I glued a piece of metal hanger wire to the balloon and then to the motor. When the motor turns, the wire pushes and pulls the balloon in a pumping motion, pulling air in through the airflow holes and pushing it back out through the air tube.</p>
