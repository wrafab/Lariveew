    <h2>Assignment: Build a "Lamp Shade" using the 3D printer</h2>

    <p><strong>Plan:</strong> I had an idea in mind for a lamp when I started. I wanted to take a glass water bottle and put it into a 3D printed base that had colorful LEDS to light up the water in the bottle. I also wanted to add an air pump and some tubeing into the lamp to give the effect of bubbles in the water.</p>
    <p><strong>CAD Work:</strong> The first step was to make the base and top of the lamp. I had a water bottle that I thought would work, so I made the base to surround that. On the bottom base, I added some stands so I would have room to put the LEDS under the water bottle. I also added a hole in the back so I could route wire through to power the LEDS. I molded the top around the cap of the water bottle so I could screw it on. This made the lamp easy to open if needed and also saved me the time and frustration of trying to waterproof the plastic top. Finally, I hollowed out the top so I had room for a small air pump and again added a hole for wires. I also made a cap for the top to cover up the hollowed gap so it would look cleaner.</p>

    <p><strong>Printing:</strong> The printed parts turned out ok, but they were a bit smaller than I thought (or the bottle was bigger). After some heavy sanding, I finally got the parts to squeeze into place. I added the LEDS to the bottom base and routed the wire out the side hole.</p>
    <p><strong>Electronics:</strong> For the air pump, I originally intended to DIY one by using a pc fan motor to push and pull a piece of rubber attached to a soda can, which would then push and pull air out of a hole in the can. This ended up as a failure because the motor was not strong enough to move the rubber. I could have bought a stronger motor, but it was cheaper to just buy a small air pump, so I went with that instead.</p>

    <p><strong>Touch Ups:</strong> Finally, I spray painted the plastic base and top matte black, glued the cap of the water bottle into the top piece, put the air tube and air stone in, and filled the bottle with water. I also placed some rocks in the bottom which covered up the green airstone and the white caulk I used to glue the bottle to the base. I then just plugged everything in and it actually worked suprisingly well. This was one of my favorite projects I did, and it also took the longest, but overall I am proud of it and am excited to show it off.</p>
