    <h2>Describe your project</h2>
    <p><strong>Plan:</strong> I wanted to create a 2.1 channel speaker that includes 2 speakers and a subwoofer. I chose this because we recently renovated out basement and I thought it could use a sick speaker system. For the design, I wanted two bookshelve-style speakers with 2 woofers in each, and a regular subwoofer. Because subwoofers are so reliant on the structure they are placed in, I decided to follow a pre-designed model instead, which can be found below.

    <h2>Step One: Cutting</h2>
    <p> After gathering my material, the first thing I did was make marks on the wood for the sub box. Since I had a 3/4 inch 1"x10"x8' and some plywood lying around, I used this instead of MDF to save money, although ideally one would want to buy one large MDF sheet to save money. Looking at the blueprints, I first made marks on the 1x10. I needed two 24" pieces, one 14.5", one 12.25", and one 20.25". These dimensions actual turned out perfect as it used no more and no less than the whole 8' board. I used a sliding miter saw to cut these as they were only 9.25 inches long, so I didn't need the circular saw yet. I also needed two 24x16", which were too big for the pine board so I marked these on the plywood instead. For these cuts, I needed to use the circular saw as the cuts were too long for the miter saw.</p>
    <p> For the speaker boxes, I used 1/2 inch MDF and cut eight 4.5"x9" pieces for the sides and four 3.5"x4.5" pieces for the tops and bottoms. I used the miter saw to cut these so it was pretty easy. For future reference though, one might want to use 3/4" MDF because it can be diffucult to nail together the boxes without cracking the 1/2".</p>  
    <p> Finally, for the subwoofer hole and woofer holes, I used Inventable's X-Carve CNC Machine. I first used their software, Easel, to create a quick CAD of the intended holes. The links for both the sub and speakers can be found below. Easel was very straightforward, and all I had to do was make a 24"x16" rectangle, center a 9.2" diameter hole in the middle and set it to "outline", set the thickness and wood type to 3/4" plywood, and it was ready to carve. I also used a 1/8" uppercut bit. For the speakers, I centered two 3" holes on a 4.5"x9" rectangle and changed the settings to 1/2" MDF and just used that design to cut 2 speaker lids. To use the X-Carve, I first had to clamp down each board, being sure to place a board underneath so the drill didn't cut the table. Then, I used the touch plate probe to calibrate the z axis, and manual moved the bit to set the x and y axis. Finally, I just pressed carve and it only took about 10 minutes for each piece to carve.</p>

	    <h2>Step Two: Building the base of the boxes</h2>
	   <p>To make the boxes, I used a nail gun with 1.25 inch nails, some wood glue, and some caulk in the corners of the sub box. The first thing I did was paint the inside of all 5 hole (2 woofers on each speaker lid, 1 subwoofer) black because I would be mounting the speakers on the inside of the boxes and therefore did not want the brown MDF/plywood to be seen. Then, I started assembling the sub box by first attaching the 24"x10" pieces to the long sides of the plywood that did not have a hole. To attach each piece of wood, I first applied a thin layer of wood glue and then used the nail gun to nail everything together. After these pieces, I did the same with the 14.5" on one side, 12.25" on the other side, and 20.25" on the inside of the 12.25" piece (see diagram in first section for better explanation). After this, caulk the inside corners of the sub box to help with stability. This would also be the time to put speaker foam in if you have that desire. DO NOT PUT THE LID ON YET.</p>
	   <p>For the speaker boxes, I first glued and nailed together the 4.5"x9" pieces, not putting the lid on these yet either. Make sure that the box is long and not square, meaning nail two pieces to the inside of another piece. At this point you should only have nails in the back of the speaker, and the left and right sides should be longer than the back. Do this for both speaker boxes, and then glue/nail the top and bottom on the inside of the boxes. This should leave you with two boxes that have no protruding sides and no front lid.</p>
    <hr>
	    <h2>Step Three: Soldering and Wiring</h2>
	    <p>While the paint on the speaker lids and caulk on the sub box dried, I started to solder my wires tomy speaker cups. The first thing I did was cut 3 even strips of 16 gauge wire, about 8 feet each. If you know where your speakers are going, you can modify these lengths to fit your setup (i.e. make the sub wire longer so that it can be further away from the amp). After this, cut off a short piece (4") from two of the wires and split both of them down the middle, giving you 4 different wires. Now, tear apart the ends of the doubled up wires about an inch so that every wire is a bit seperated (this will help when inserting the wires into the amp later. Strip every single end of every wire (there should be 20 ends total), and twist together the ends.</p>
	    <p>Since we will be wiring the woofers in parallel to reduce the total OHMs rather than doule them by wiring in series, split one end of each WOOFER wire (not the subwoofer wire) down the middle about 6 inches. Then, carefully strip the base of each of these wires. This can be tricky with regular wire cutters, so I used an exacto knife to cut open the protective layer, and then cut around the wire. I soldered one of the 4 single wires I made earlier to each of these spots, and covered it in heatshirnk to protect it (alternatively you can use electrical tape). In the end, I had one plain sub wire with stripped ends, and two speaker wires with one end plain and stripped, and the other with 2 wires that split into 4 wires, kind of looking like a tree. All of these were stripped as well.</p>
	    <p>Finally you can either crimp terminals onto one end of every wire, or solder the wire directly to the speaker. I chose to crimp the wires, as I wanted to be able to take the wires off easily in the future. For the woofers, crimp 2 small terminals to to each end of one branch of wires on each woofer wire. One the other branch of each wire, crimp 2 larger terminals. Also, crimp a small and a large terminal to either end of the sub wire. Although it really doesn't matter, try to stay consistent with what wire you put the small and large terminals on. The small ones are negative, and the large are positives. The wire I got has a stripe on one side of the wire. I chose to make the striped wire my positive, so I always crimped the large terminals to the striped wire, and the smaller negative terminals to the unmarked wire. Once this is all done, you can connect the terminals to the speaker cups and subwoofer. <strong>In the end, your speakers should like the image to the right</strong></p>
	    <p>At this point, you can also put some 1/4" wire sleeving and some heatshrink on your wires for looks. To do this, expand the wire sleeving put condensing it together, and work it over each wire (only go to about 3 inches away from the branched out wires on the woofers, as they do not need to be covered because they will be in the speaker box). Then, cut the end off of each sleeve, push it up so that the wires' ends are still exposed, and slide some heatshrink onto both sides of every wire and heat it up to keep everything in place.
    <hr>
	    <h2>Step Four: Finishing the boxes</h2>
	    <p>Finally, you can scrrew the 4 woofers and subwoofer onto the backs of the speaker lids. Make sure to use short self-tapping screws so they don't poke through the other side. I used 5/8" screws. After this, I drilled a 1/2" hole into the backs of each speaker box and the sub box I built to route the wires through. For the sub box, be careful where you make this hole, and decide how you want your sub to stand in your setup beforehand so the wire does not get in the way. After routing the wires through, I used thin finishing screws to put the peaker lids on. This was so I could get into the speaker later if I needed to. It's also important to pre-drill a small hole for the screws of you have thinner wood so the wood doesn't crack.</p>
	    <p>If you want to put vinyl on the speakers, you may need to sand the edges so that they are smooth before placing the vinyl on. Also make sure the MDF is clean of saw dust or else the vinyl won't stick well. Alternatively, you can paint the boxes.</p>
	    <p>At this point, your speakers will work. To use them, unscrew the terminal screws on the long side of the amp (opposite of the knobs), and place the end of the sub wire in the one marked "sub", the left speaker's wires in the "left" socket, and the right in the "right". Make sure that the positives and negatives are correct by looking at the stripe or wire color, and also make sure the waires are not touching AT ALL or else the amp can short out. Plug the power supply into the dc jack, and an audio source into the audio jack, and you have sound!</p>

	    <h2>Reflection</h2>
	    <p>Overall, I spent about 2 full days on these speaker over a 2 week period, and another day creating this site. I spent a lot of late nights up sanding and wiring, and even more time picking out the parts. Since I already had a lot of the items I needed, I only spent a grand total of about 120$ on my speakers, which I think is a good price for their sound quailty, voluume, customized design, and the experience. What I loved about building these speakers, and really anything, was how customizable everything was. I love bass, so I made my subwoofer really large and boomy. And my desk is made of walnut, so I plan to cover the speakers in a walnut vinyl in the future. They are the perfect speaker for me, and it's also cool to be able to say that I am the only person in the world that has them.</p>

	    <p>In terms of what I learned, I definitely expanded my knowledge of electronics. I learned the basics of RMS amounts vs. Max amounts (RMS is the max continuous current the speaker can handle, while the max is just the max amount of current it can handle overall). I also learned abut OHMs, voltage, amps, and watts, and how they all work with each other (see picture to the side). I strengthened my skills with the soldering iron, I learned how to use the CNC machine, learned that sanding by hand sucks, and learned a lot about how sound works and how to get the best sound from your speakers and sub.</p>
