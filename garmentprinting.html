    <h2>Assignment: Design an original T-Shirt and print it on the Brother GT-361 printer</h2>
    <p>I printed a Tshirt that said Junior Varsity, because I'm on Junior Varsity</p>

    <p> The printed parts turned out ok, but they were a bit smaller than I thought (or the bottle was bigger).After some heavy sanding, I finally got the parts to squeeze into place. I added the LEDS to the bottom base and routed the wire out the side hole. Instead of buying an air pump, I decided to try and make one using a bottle cap, a balloon, and a computer fan motor.</p>
    <p> I secured the balloon tightly onto the bottle cap with a clamp and some super glue. I drilled 3 holes into the cap, 1 for the air tube and 2 for airflow. In front of the airflow holes I glued some rubber so the pumped air would be forced out the air tube instead of back out the holes. After some modifications to the motor, I glued a piece of metal hanger wire to the balloon and then to the motor. When the motor turns, the wire pushes and pulls the balloon in a pumping motion, pulling air in through the airflow holes and pushing it back out through the air tube.</p>
