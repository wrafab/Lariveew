    <h2><strong>Assignment: Make a skateboard using Titebond III Glue and Vacuum Forming</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Building Process:</strong> Because the glue used on these skateboards started to dry so fast, the first step to making the skateboards was to set everything up. I got about a cup of Titebond III glue and placed it in a cup on the table. Next, since I would be vacuum forming the bag later, I placed a strip of air tight tar tape on the top of the bag and pressed one side of it down, as this would save time later. Finally, I started glueing the layers together with my partner. After the first glue want on, I had about seven minutes to get the skateboard sealed into the bag. The skateboard had seven layers that alternated between long-grain and short-grain. The long-grain made the board more sturdy, while the short-grain made it more felixble. After glueing the layers, I placed the skateboard on a styrofoam mold so it would curve at the ends and taped the board to the styrofoam to keep it from moving. I placed the whole thing in the vacuum bag and put the rebreather mesh over the vacuum hole so that the suction wouldn't mess up the vacuum sealing. I then pressed down the tar tape I had placed earlier, making sure it was air tight (or what I though was air tight), and used a pump to vacuum seal the bag until I heard clicking. I left the board to dry overnight, but when I took it out of the bag the next morning, it appeared that the bag hadn't been sealed air tight and some air had seemed in. As a result of this, the board was barely curved around the styrofoam and the layers had moved a bit and were not stuck together well. Anyways, I was running out of time, so I used the edge remover and sander to get rid of the sticking-out edges, and used some wood glue and clamps to glue the weak parts of layers back together. Besides the uncurved sides, it ended up looking okay.</p>
    <p><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> To decorate the skateboard, I found an geometric pattern I thought would look cool on the skateboard and uploaded it to CorelDraw. I cropped the image to fit in a 32"x8" space (the dimensions of the skateboard), and finally contoured around the image with the specific Roland pink that the machine used to recognize a cut path. Finally, I exported the file as a .eps and printed it on the 540i. I stuck the vinyl to the skateboard's bottom and trimmed around the edges with an exacto knife, which worked better than I originally thought. I then coated the board with the SPAR urethane and let it dry. Overall, the skateboard looks really cool, and now I just wish I had the slightest idea of how to use it.
